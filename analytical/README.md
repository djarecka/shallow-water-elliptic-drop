Codes for reproducing Figs. 1-3.
================================

For plotting Figs. 1-3, you need Python with scientific libraries 
(e.q. NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, h5py). 

Figure 1 (both panels) can be obtained by running:
    $ python ellipse_evolution_odeint.py

Figure 2 you will can be obtained by running:
    $ python energy_conserv.py

Figure 3 you will can be obtained by running:
    $ python circle_evolution.py
